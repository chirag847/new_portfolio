  - üîä **Voice Playback**: AI responses are automatically spoken aloud
  - üéß **Audio Controls**: Toggle auto-speak on/off, manual playback controls
  - üë® **Male Voice**: Uses Abhilash voice for professional, clear speech
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive chat interface with glassmorphism design
- **Smart Context**: Maintains conversation context for more natural interactions
- **Fallback System**: Works even without API keys using intelligent fallback responses
- **Theme Support**: Adapts to light/dark theme preferences

### Setup Instructions

1. **Get Google Gemini API Key (FREE!)**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

   # Edit .env and add your API keys
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   VITE_SARVAM_API_KEY=your_sarvam_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Customize Your Information**
   - Edit `src/services/chatService.ts`
   - Update the `defaultUserInfo` object with your personal information:
     - Name, skills, experience, projects, bio, education, achievements, interests

### Usage

### Browser Requirements

For voice features to work:

### Security Note

For production deployment, it's recommended to:
- Use a backend service to handle API calls (OpenAI + Sarvam AI)

- Adjusting voice parameters in `sarvamAIService.ts`
- Customizing audio controls and recording settings

### Troubleshooting Voice Features

#### **"Could not transcribe audio" Error**

This error typically occurs due to:

1. **Audio Recording Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Check browser console for errors
   # Look for "Recording audio", "Converting audio" logs
   # Verify audio duration is at least 1-2 seconds
   ```

2. **API Key Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Verify your Sarvam AI API key in .env
   VITE_SARVAM_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
   
   # Restart the dev server after adding the key
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Audio Format Issues**:
   - The app now converts WebM to WAV automatically
   - Check browser console for "Audio converted to WAV" message
   - Ensure recording duration is at least 2 seconds
   - Try speaking louder and clearer

4. **Network/API Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Check network tab in browser dev tools
   # Look for failed requests to api.sarvam.ai
   # Check for 400/401/429 status codes
   # Verify API key permissions and quotas
   ```

5. **Sarvam AI Specific Issues**:
   ```bash
   # The app now sends proper File objects to Sarvam API
   # Check console for "Sending audio to Sarvam AI" logs
   # Look for specific error messages in console
   ```

#### **Microphone Not Working**

1. **Browser Permissions**:
   - Click the microphone icon in address bar
   - Grant microphone permissions
   - Refresh the page after granting permissions

2. **HTTPS Requirement**:
   - Microphone access requires HTTPS in production
   - Works on localhost for development
   - Deploy with SSL certificate for production

3. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (modern versions)
   - Mobile browsers may have limitations
   - Check console for "Web Audio API" support messages

#### **No Audio Playback**

1. **Browser Audio Policy**:
   - Most browsers require user interaction before audio playback
   - Click the speaker button manually first time
   - Check browser audio settings

2. **Audio Format Issues**:
   - Sarvam AI returns base64 encoded audio
   - Check console for "Audio playback failed" messages
   - Verify audio data is being received

#### **Debug Mode**

Enable detailed logging by opening browser console:
```javascript
// Check audio recording
console.log('Recording state:', mediaRecorder.state);

// Check API responses  
console.log('Sarvam responses in Network tab');

// Test API connectivity (paste in console)
// (Only works if chatbot is open)
```

#### **Common Solutions**

1. **Refresh the page** and try again
2. **Clear browser cache** and reload
3. **Check internet connection** for API calls
4. **Use headphones** to avoid audio feedback
5. **Speak clearly** and avoid background noise

#### **API Limits**

- Sarvam AI has usage limits per API key
- Check your quota at https://www.sarvam.ai/
- Monitor console for rate limiting errors
